[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This modification allows you to divide your categories into subforums, a pseudo-forum located on a different directory, subdomain, or domain than the "primary forum".  The primary forum is any forum that has this modification installed.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]What It Does[/u][/size][/b][/color]
[quote author=Terry at Moke link=topic=523055.msg3713355#msg3713355 date=1403833435]
It is a mod for the User side of things, but obviously it needs to be managed in the Admin pages to create the subforums, and this mod allows you to create Categories and Boards that appear to the end user as a separate Forum, either via the URL or even the domain name, and these separate Forums can have their own Themes as well. However it all shares the same database as your original forum so usernames, passwords, profiles etc are all the same so there is less for you and the end users to manage.

Without this mod if you wanted to limit access to particular Boards based you could set up a membergroup and just give them access to the Board(s) required and then they would see the extra Board(s) as part of the main Forum page, however they would still see the rest of the Forum as it is with the same theme etc. Yes you can change the theme for a Board but that would be a bit abrupt in most cases. 

With this mod you are essentially doing the same thing with the Membergroup and Board(s) regarding settng up the access but they get to see the Boards as a separate Forum, [u]without[/u] all the other boards they might have access too and with a completely different theme if you wish. In the subForum they see the same stats, who is online, News, menu options etc. relative to the membergroup access they have, but with just the Boards you have chosen for them to see.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Alterations[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There is a new area at [b][i]Admin[/i] -> [i]Forum[/i] -> [i]SubForums[/i][/b], which allows you to manage your subforums here.  Clicking on the board title on the left side will take you to the subforum itself.  Clicking on the [b]Boards[/b] link on the right side will take you to the [b][i]Admin[/i] -> [i]Forum[/i] -> [i]Boards[/i][/b] area, restricted to that subforum.

On the primary subforum, creating a subforum is as easy as clicking on the [b]Create New SubForum[/b] tab (and/or button) and filling out the information in order to create your new subforum.  This mod can create the folder and generate an "index.php" if required.  Subforum user registration agreements are mantained by the mod.

Clicking on [b]Modify[/b] opens a page where you can change settings for that subforum, such as:
o Changing the title of the subforum
o Changing the server URL and/or path of the subforum
o Adding a favorites icon to the subforum
o Changing the default theme of the subforum
o Changing the default language of the subforum
o Changing the subforum ID on secondary subforums
o Changing the primary membergroup of new users registered to the subforum

Clicking on the [b]Delete[/b] button will prompt what to do with categories within the board and will delete once the decision has been made by the user.

On the [b][i]Admin[/i] -> [i]Forum[/i] -> [i]Boards[/i][/b] page using the primary subforum, the categories and boards are seperated by which subforum they belong to.  On secondary subforums, only those categories and boards that belong to that subforum show up.

"Package Manager" and "Server Settings" settings are not available to Subforums, as these screens contain sensitive information that affects all subforums.

All recent posts, xml-based feeds, and other forum-related functionality works for each of the individual subforums.
